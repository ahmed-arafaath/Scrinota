# Scrinota 
*Current Version: 1.0*

The current version in this repo is a prototype version for the final project of the course CS50: Introduction to Computer Science.

**Scrinota** is a chrome extension that lets you take notes on your chrome tabs and as well help's you set reminders on the websites that you wish to come back to later.

This prototype version will only include a reminder option, where a user can set up a date and time for any particular website they wish to visit in the future. When the time comes, an alert will pop in the chrome extension with the description user stored when setting up the timer.
