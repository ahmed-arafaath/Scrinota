## Project Description

### Concept

**Scrinota** is a chrome extension that lets you the user set up reminders to open a webpage at a specific time in the future and as well with a feature to add notes for any given website that you the user can access anytime along with the webpage.

Design features to implement/implemented:
* Reminder to open webpage at any time in future, reducing the current active tabs.
* Take notes on webpage and view notes specific to a current webpage with option to view all the notes.
* Option to set reminder for notes along with webpage.
* To implement a cross platform application for all devices.

### Reason for this project
I noticed that I always tend to have several chrome tabs open, my intention to open all those tabs was that I might have found them useful and I wanted to visit them at a later date. All those tabs end up staying in my current browser for weeks and to be honest I still have not noticed some of them yet because just like one particular tab, I have couple more tabs open.

Doing this has cost me my PCâ€™s memory and an overwhelming number of tabs being open. After talking to some people about the idea, I realized that other people who do the same thing. Hence, an idea sparked in my mind where I thought what if I create a chrome extension that acts as a reminder for accessing webpage. Along with the reminder feature, I thought adding notes taking feature specific to links would also be an added benefit for organizing notes. This way I do not have to keep the webpage as one of my current open tabs and I can free up some of my memory for other uses.

### Tools and APIs used
1. Web developement tools - HTML, CSS (Framework-<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>), Javascript.
2. APIs used - <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/">Chrome.Storage</a>, <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/windows/">Chrome.windows</a>, <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/notifications/">Chrome.notifications</a>, <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/alarms/">Chrome.alarms</a>.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This extension was built for the chrome browser platform, I would recommend to get familiar with using the chrome browser before playing around with the extension.

Follow this <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/thank-you.html?statcb=1&installdataindex=empty&defaultbrowser=0">link</a> to download chrome browser.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
 
2. Open the chrome browser and type *chrome://extensions* into the address bar.
3. In the extension page, toggle the developer mode button and you will see 













This prototype version will only include a reminder option, where a user can set up a date and time for any particular website they wish to visit in the future. When the time comes, an alert will pop in the chrome extension with the description user stored when setting up the timer.
